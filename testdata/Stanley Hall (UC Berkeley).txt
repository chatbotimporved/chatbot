Bplan is the UC Berkeley Startup Competition focused on IT & Web, Life 
Sciences, Energy & Cleantech, and Consumer Products & Services. As part 
of the competition, teams with at least one UC Berkeley/UCSF student or 
alum submit an executive summary of their idea by January 30, 2014. If 
the idea is among the 10 in its field selected, the team receives 
mentorship from industry experts and has the opportunity to win $10,000.
