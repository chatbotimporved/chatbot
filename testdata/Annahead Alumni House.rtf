The RCSA Career Reception is uniquely organized for scholars in order to provide scholars with the exclusive opportunity to network with representatives from a diverse number of firms. \'a0The goal of the reception is to foster a small-scale and personal environment in which scholars can freely converse and network with recruiters. \'a0We highly encourage all scholars to attend, even for half an hour, for there will be opportunities available to scholars of all years, majors, and interests. \'a0In addition, these is the added benefit of attending this event in that all the recruiters are well aware that RCSA is the top 2 percent of the University - they will want you just as much as you want to work for them! \'a0Plus, there will be some RCSA alums there who are more than eager to hire some future RCSA alums!\
\'a0\
Firms in attendance: IBM, KPMG, Target, Northwestern Mutual, Citrix, Carno ChemRisk, and many more!\

Refreshments and light snacks provided. \'a0No dress code, but business casual is recommended.\'a0\
