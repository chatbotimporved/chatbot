Description: A new breed of company founders are questioning the status quo that successful businesses must develop and sell products in order to grow.  Instead, the leaders of “sharing economy” companies focus on gleaning new value out of existing ones. The evening will begin with a networking reception showcasing some of the innovative local companies turning traditional business models on their heads.  Following that, Lisa Gansky, entrepreneur, investor, and author, will explore the sharing economy landscape today and Adam Werbach and Andy Ruben will talk about the co-founding of yerdle, a Bay Area company that helps members share and receive free items with their social network.
