\f0\i\fs24 \cf0 An informal session about designing your online portfolio led by I School Alumna Maggie Law. Relevant for design- and research-oriented students alike, she'll share a few insights (from the hiring manager's perspective) to help guide your efforts to document and promote your academic and professional project work. There's no one right answer, but there are many wrong ones; she'll talk you through a few of the worst offenders, and highlight some techniques that make great portfolios stand out.\
