Sunday | 11/17 | 11:30 AM-7 PM | Vacaville Ice Sports (leave from West Circle)
 
Do you like ice skating, eating ice cream, and meeting new people?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, come out to our semester social with UC Davis’s RSS!
 
We will be skating at Vacaville Ice Sports, and we’ll recover from our bumps and bruises afterward at Fenton's Creamery in Vacaville.  We should be back by dinner time.
 
Total costs for everything should be around $30. This can be lowered considerably if people can bring their own cars, so if you own a car, please consider helping RCSA out by driving!
