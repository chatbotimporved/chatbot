This evening, I will be giving a presentation on White House Internships for the Cal Democrats in my capacity as a former staff assistant whose job it was to oversee the selection and placement of White House interns.

If you're considering a public service internship this summer, I highly recommend applying for a White House Internship!


White House Internship Information Session
Date, time: Today, November 7 @ 8pm
Location: Dwinelle Hall 242

All are welcome, and additionally, I'd be happy to provide more specific guidance and answers to I School members.Â
